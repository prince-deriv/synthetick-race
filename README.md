## ‚ùìAbout

1.  **What is Synthetick Race**

    ```shell
    It is a simple gatsby application that allow humans to race with 5 other computer cars.
    It consumes deriv api and uses the ticks to determine random bonuses 
    ```

2.  **Game Mechanics**

    ```shell
    Players are allowed to select 6 different car colors, a lucky number from 0 to 9 and a synthethic market.
    While on race if the lucky number of their choice showed up as the last digit on the next tick 
    of the synthetic instrument they have chose, the player will get a permanent bonus top speed and a 3 second invulnerability 
    same luck happens to the other cars. The first who reached the finish like wins the game.
    ```

3.  **Game Rules**

    ```shell
    - Cars that are invulnerable can never explode.
    - Slower car will explode when a collision happens between two or more cars
    - Bumping on obstacles affects car speed and can even destroy the car. 
    - Moving left or right reduces car speed
    ```

4.  **Obstacles**
